# weather-dashboard
For this project I made a weather dashboard that uses the openweather api to get current and future weather information about the city that is searched for. The information returned is the temperature, wind, humidity, and the UV index which is identified as low, mid, or high by assigning it a color (green, yellow, and red) when it is presented. it also gives you the forecast for the next five days and keeps a list of recent cities you have searched for that you can click on to return that locations information again.

# Features
* When you type in a city and hit search the main box on the page will populate the city name and date, along with the temp, wind, humidity, and UV index.

* Below that box you will find the 5-day forecast for that location

* When you refresh the page or go back into the application after you have closed out of it you are presented with the info of the last location you seaeerched and a list of cities you have searched for in the past.
